## Steps

### User Authentication and Authorization:

1. Implement user authentication and role-based access control to secure the application and manage user permissions.

### Integration with Splunk REST API:

1. Utilize Splunk's REST API to query access log data from Splunk indexes, enabling real-time data retrieval and analysis.

### Statistical Analysis:

1.  Perform statistical analysis on log data to generate metrics such as total requests, unique visitors, most active clients, popular URLs, average bytes transferred, etc.

### Geolocation Mapping:

1.  Utilize IP geolocation data to map client IP addresses to their geographical locations. Display this information on interactive maps to visualize the distribution of website visitors.

### Data Visualization:

1.  Create interactive charts and graphs to visualize trends and patterns in web traffic, session activity, and other metrics. Support various chart types such as line charts, bar charts, pie charts, heatmaps, etc.

### Search and Filtering:

1.  Implement search and filtering capabilities to allow users to narrow down data based on specific criteria such as time range, client IP address, session ID, etc.

### Real-time Monitoring:

1.  Enable real-time monitoring of access log data, with automatic updates and alerts for unusual or suspicious activity detected in the logs.

### Export and Reporting: 

1.  Allow users to export analysis results and reports in various formats (e.g., CSV, PDF) for further analysis or sharing with stakeholders.

### Customizable Dashboards: 

1.  Allow users to customize their dashboards with widgets, charts, and panels to monitor the metrics and insights most relevant to them.


### Conclusion

This project demonstrates the implementation of a robust security solution using Splunk, showcasing my skills in log management, threat detection, using dashboards and etc.
